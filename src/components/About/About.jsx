        -I am responsible and reliable, which I proved by leading a project to
        modernize the inventory accounting system. I show initiative and
        creativity by proposing a non-standard approach to a marketing campaign
        when a company enters a new market. I have strong communication skills
        and the ability to work in a team, which helped me successfully
        coordinate a project team to develop a new product.
